# GoalPlanner Web App
This is the first app that I've developed and it's of my own devising with the goal to learn programming. Please bear this in mind if you plan to use this code! My goal to learn programming is also related to the function of the app;
* sign up for your own GoalPlanner account
* setting goals, subgoals and activities
* check off the activities
* track the progress of the subgoals and the overall progress of the main goal(s)

[You can find the deployed version on goalplannerapp.herokuapp.com](https://goalplannerapp.herokuapp.com/)

With this app I'm also going to finish Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) course, as this is my final project.
